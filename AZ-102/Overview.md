Main focus of the certification exam to work with solutions architects(data engineer, data scientists,architects, etc..) help them to Leverage the Secure end to end AI solutions. 

Planned Exam Journey [Exam AI-102 page](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/exams/ai-102)

Focussed Study Topics: 
* Plan and manage an Azure AI solution (15–20%)
* Implement decision support solutions (10–15%)
* Implement computer vision solutions (15–20%)
* Implement natural language processing solutions (30–35%)
* Implement knowledge mining and document intelligence solutions (10–15%)
* Implement generative AI solutions (10–15%)

artificial intelligence is utilized in most of the domains nowadays and its emerging day by day.
* visual perception
* text analysis and conversion
* speech
* decision making

Data Science:
Suppose an iceberg is menlting on a average of 2tons per year. A data scientist may take those data of each year with diff seasons conditions. 

**Collecting the data and segregating it for the actual usage**

Machine Learning:
It is a subset of data science. If a data scientist uses the data to train the model which the algorithm helps   
Predict values for unknown labels.

_Contd. from prev passage_ - **By collecting those data he writes an algorithm to predict the values of global warming, consumption and wastage of river water**

Artificial Intelligence:
Creates a software that emulates one or more characteristics of human intelligence.

_Contd. from prev passage_ - **Regularly monitoring the water level to balance the human's life.**
