Main focus of the certification exam to work with solutions architects(data engineer, data scientists,architects, etc..) help them to Leverage the Secure end to end AI solutions. 

Exam Path [Exam AI-102 page](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/exams/ai-102)

##### Focussed Study Topics: 
* Plan and manage an Azure AI solution (15–20%)
* Implement decision support solutions (10–15%)
* Implement computer vision solutions (15–20%)
* Implement natural language processing solutions (30–35%)
* Implement knowledge mining and document intelligence solutions (10–15%)
* Implement generative AI solutions (10–15%)

artificial intelligence is utilized in most of the domains nowadays and its emerging day by day.
* visual perception
* text analysis and conversion
* speech
* decision making

##### Data Science:
Suppose an iceberg is menlting on a average of 2tons per year. A data scientist may take those data of each year with diff seasons conditions. 

**Collecting the data and segregating it for the actual usage**

##### Machine Learning:
It is a subset of data science. If a data scientist uses the data to train the model which the algorithm helps   
Predict values for unknown labels.

_Contd. from prev passage_ - **By collecting those data he writes an algorithm to predict the values of global warming, consumption and wastage of river water**

##### Artificial Intelligence:
Creates a software that emulates one or more characteristics of human intelligence.

_Contd. from prev passage_ - **Regularly monitoring the water level to balance the human's life.**

##### Understand considerations for AI Engineers
###### Purpose of AI engineers:
Data engineer will be handling large volumes of data and for ML it requires huge source of compute engine. Most of the emerging tech happened in cloud recent times. Suppose if they wanted to move their product to the cloud. AI engineer can help them migrating their product with azure services.

To fully capitalize on the opportunities of AI, software engineers fo require at least a conceptual understanding of core AI and ML principles.

##### Model Training and Inferencing:
During model training, some of the data will be present in the new observations (_Features_) &
(_Label_) the value that the model is being trained to predict.
###### Inferencing: 
Once the model has been trained, you can include the new values of _Feaures_ and _Lables_. 

##### Probability & Confidence Scores:
Software engineers should make use of **confidence score** values to evaluate predictions and apply appropriate threshold to optimize application reliablity and mitigate the risk of prediction.

Probability should be only a statistical data and the values given by ML models.

##### Responsible AI and ethics
* Fairness
* Reliability and safety
* Privacy and security
* Inclusiveness
* Transparency
* Accountability
